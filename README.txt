First time messing around with Machine Learning, guided and taught from scratch by Iris Ng Hui Ling: https://github.com/NgHuiLingIris

Data set is from kaggle in the topic of Young People Survey.

From this machine learning model, we tried to clusters of people in terms of music preference and find a correlation between their music preference cluster to their spending habits to figure out which market will be most lucrative to target advertising and sales efforts to.

Next steps that we are exploring is to build a model on people's demographic to predict which cluster of musi preference will they belong to.
